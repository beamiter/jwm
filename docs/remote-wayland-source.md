# Native Wayland single-surface source (experimental)

This slice adds a native Wayland **source** to `jwm-remote`; the existing viewer
still uses X11. Building the helper with `remote-wayland` also enables its shared
`remote-x11` code, but selecting a Wayland source must not connect to X11.
It is not a production-complete remote desktop or a native Wayland viewer.

## Local, single-use selection

```sh
jwm-remote host --wayland-select --once --key-file /path/to/session.key
# Optionally select a specific native socket with --wayland-display wayland-0.
```

The trusted local host enumerates current foreign-toplevel handles on one
Wayland connection and asks for a one-based index on its own stdin. Titles and
application IDs are bounded, escaped labels only, not lookup keys. The selected
live protocol resource is retained while creating its capture source and session
on that same connection. There is no identifier re-resolution, title matching,
automatic replacement, reconnect or source switch. An invalid choice, closed
handle or timeout ends the attempt. The host creates this session before it
announces a network listener.

`--key-stdin` cannot be combined with local selection: they would compete for
stdin. Use a key file without putting key contents in logs or command history.
The default network listener remains loopback; the normal transport key and
trusted-LAN restrictions continue to apply. The network viewer cannot choose
which native window to share.

This authorization boundary is the user explicitly launching a trusted local
host and selecting its current resource. Existing compositor capture globals
are not a new per-client capability system or isolation from other unsandboxed
local capture applications. This path performs no IPC/native resize action and
therefore does not use an X11 nonce or cross-connection native window lookup.

## Narrow capture contract

Only the selected native surface tree at logical-resolution scale 1 may be rendered. There is no desktop,
output, root-rectangle or overlay fallback. Global cursors, keyboard, pointer,
clipboard and remote resize remain disabled. Extra source grants, X11 selection
options and input permissions are rejected rather than ignored.

The client uses one in-flight SHM capture at a time and accepts only bounded
XRGB8888 buffers with a normal transform. Size, stride and allocation arithmetic
must be checked before allocation/readback. The existing frame limits also bound
the encoded canvas. Changing a viewer viewport changes only encoding, never the
application's native geometry.

A closed/unmapped source, lock transition, native source size change, or committed
buffer scale/transform change ends this
first-stage grant permanently, even after remap/unlock/resize-back. The server
must bind the captured surface and its mapping/lock generation, and revalidate
queued frames before rendering; checking only when a session was created is
insufficient. The native server bounds live sources to 256 and sessions to 512;
overflow produces inert/stopped objects, not a fallback capture. The renderer
requires exact buffer geometry and must not send ready after a failed copy.
Output capture is not covered by this single-surface hardening. The client must treat stopped/failed/disconnected sessions as
terminal, not rebuild a source. Already delivered pixels cannot be recalled;
the recipient may retain what they have seen.

## Validation boundaries

Run fresh client/state tests and real protocol requests against the compositor
for lifecycle ordering, malformed constraints, selection cancellation and lock
revocation. Wire-state tests do not exercise GL pixels. A nested/offscreen
renderer test must be labeled as such, not as real DRM/KMS verification. Actual
DRM validation still requires a native session and capture of a known surface,
including occlusion, lock and unmap races. Neither compilation nor a synthetic
nested display is evidence that physical-display capture has passed.
